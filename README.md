# Heartonograph

A project by Sam Bishamber, Manuel Castro, Lucia Liu, Ben Reynolds, and Justin Xiao.

## How to Use

1. Step 1 - Microsoft Band

Wear a Microsoft Band, download the _Microsoft Health_ app on your iPhone, and bluetooth pair the band with your phone.

2. Step 2 - iOS App

Open the _Band Samples_ workspace in the _iOS App_ directory, and build the _BandHeartRate_ target on your phone. Determine the IP address of your desktop computer (e.g. 18.189.11.222, can be located in the _Network_ page in Mac OSX System Preferences), and enter that value into the text field within the app.

Tap _Start Heart Rate Sensor_ to begin collecting data and broadcasting it to the Host IP on port 3001.

3. Step 3 - Mac OSX App

Run the _Heartonograph Desktop Receiver_ Mac App in the _Mac OSX App_ directory. The _Path to heart rate data_ field may be changed if you want to save the data received from the iPhone in a different location.

Your computer is now listening for heart rate data from the phone, and is saving the data in the designated .txt file.

4. Step 4 - Arduino

Open the _Heartonograph.ino_ file with the Arduino editor. Plug in the Arduino for the Heartonograph via USB, and select its serial port in the Tools -> Port menu.

Upload the program to your Arduino.

5. Step 5 - Processing

Open the _harmonograph_singlevalue_ file in the _Processing_ directory. This is a Java file in the Processing environment. Update the _filepath_ variable's value to match the .txt file designated in the _Heartonograph Desktop Receiver_ app.

Change the _portAddress_ variable's value to match the port you selected in the Tools -> Port menu for the Arduino.

**When you are ready, press _Run_ to execute the Processing program.** This will read the heart rate data collected by the Mac app and relay it to the Arduino via its serial port. The Arduino reads in this data sets the frequencies of each stepper motor independently to be separate functions of the incoming heart rate. The ratio of the frequencies causes the Heartonograph arm to move in different Lissajous curves, which are traced out by the attached marker.
